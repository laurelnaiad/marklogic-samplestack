##### Browse Tags

The user may browse a full list of tags _**that appear in documents which match the set of criteria specified in the explore state.**_.

This means that if the user has specified a date range, for example, in the explore state, then only those tags which appear in documents *within that date range* will be available in the browse tags dialog.

Within the list the displayed tags may be filtered by specifying a substring of a tag name.
