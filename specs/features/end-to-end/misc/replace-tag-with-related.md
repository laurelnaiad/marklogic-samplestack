**Notes:**

If a tag is related to any other tags in the currently displayed Question list, it will reveal a "related tags" indicator on rollover (A).

- This applies to both selected and unselected tags.
- Click anywhere on the tag (other than the checkbox) to show a
"Related Tags" menu (B).
- The Related Tags counts should reflect their occurrence in
the currently displayed Question list. (Or maybe not; see
Questions, below.)
- Click a related tag to select only that tag (C), clearing all other
tags. As when any other tag filter change is made:
- The Question list is updated accordingly.
- The count for the just-selected tag (D) should reflect the
updated Question list.
- n of the remaining most commonly used tags should be
shown (E), reflecting the updated Question list.
- Search Box contents should be preserved.
