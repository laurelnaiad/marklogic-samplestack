##### View Logged In Account Info

A user who is logged in is a `Contributor`.

A contributor may view details of their account at any time.

While viewing the account details, the user may elect to log out of the application. The application drops the user credentials from its memory on both the browser and the server and the user takes on the `Visitor` role.
