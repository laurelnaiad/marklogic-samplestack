## Platforms and Architectural Dependencies

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/): "Node.js® is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices."
- [Bower](http://bower.io/): "Web sites are made of lots of things — frameworks, libraries, assets, utilities, and rainbows. Bower manages all these things for you."
- [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/): "RequireJS is a JavaScript file and module loader. It is optimized for in-browser use, but it can be used in other JavaScript environments, like Rhino and Node. Using a modular script loader like RequireJS will improve the speed and quality of your code."
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/): "The streaming build system"
- [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/): "HTML enhanced for web apps!"
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/): "Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world."
- [mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/): "Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on node.js and the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun. Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases."
- [Chai](http://chaijs.com/): "Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework."
- [Protractor](http://angular.github.io/protractor/): "Protractor is an end-to-end test framework for AngularJS applications. Protractor runs tests against your application running in a real browser, interacting with it as a user would."
- [Cucumber.js](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js): "Cucumber lets software development teams describe how software should behave in plain text. The text is written in a business-readable domain-specific language and serves as documentation, automated tests and development-aid - all rolled into one format."

## Continuous Integration/Testing

- [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/): "Travis CI is a hosted continuous integration service. It is integrated with GitHub and offers first class support for [most common langauges]."
- [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/): "Automatically run your Selenium tests and Javascript Unit tests across 300+ mobile and desktop browser/OS platforms. We provide the test infrastructure so you can focus on releasing great web apps."
