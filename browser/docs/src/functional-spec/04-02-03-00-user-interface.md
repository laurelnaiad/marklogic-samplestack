### User Interface

_Inclusion of wireframes and full documentation within this specification is a work-in-progress. As the features are worked, their specification within this document will be detailed. **Refer to the complete [Wireframes Specification document](https://wiki.marklogic.com/download/attachments/29953092/Reference%20Architecture%20Demo%20Application%20Wireframes%20v0.5.pdf) for a single-page PDF view into the annotated wireframes.**_  

The User Experience/User Interface for the Samplestack *Application* is specified by Wireframes and Features.

Within the repository the features are to be specified using [Gherkin](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin), which allows for expression of scenarios that should be supported by features. These scenarios illustrate how the user and application are expected to interact in specific circumstances in the context of the applications features.

Please refer to the wireframes for UX specification.
