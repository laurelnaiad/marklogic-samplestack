## Reliability

One of the goals of Samplestack is to demonstrate how to build robust, serious applications with the reference architecture. As such, we will deliver sufficient tests to minimize the risk that the browser application may be either unstable or buggy, and will attempt to test it across a variety of operating systems and platforms.

Beyond that, reliability as might typically apply to multi-user application environments, is not a major factor in design.
