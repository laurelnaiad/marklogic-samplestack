## Security

We balance the security requirements for production environments with looser configurations for development environments.

In general, the application must support employment of all typical defensive measures for browser apps, in particular encryption at the network layer (HTTPS), Cross-Origin Policy with selective Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration, Cross Site Request Forgery protection (CSRF aka XSRF) and the protection of credentials.

Security, including design goals and constraints that relate to it, are discussed in detail in [section TODO]().
