## Author's Note

This version of the document does not yet reflect late-breaking or not yet final design decisions:

- "score" will be renamed to "votes" in the user interface
- a design for the application to offer users the option to log in if no resource is found for a URL is TBD

Additionally, detailed designs for some components will be developed within Milestone 3 and included in a future version of this document.

API documentation will be fleshed out and may be merged with the portions of this specification that are deemed suitable for the public into a consolidated online documentation offering.
