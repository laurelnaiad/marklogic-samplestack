## For Developers

### Functional Description

The development environment is automated as a set of gulp tasks which perform its functions through the command line.

A majority of the code uses Node.js streams to process files in the file system, while other areas invoke external utilities such as test runners.

### APIs (N/A)

While developers may examine the build process automation code or the application itself, they are not expected to interact with either programmatically. Alterations to the developer experience are not supported within the scope of the Samplestack development process, though they may be supported through training offerings. As such, APIs for the developer are out of scope for this document.

While there is no public API for Samplestack to document here, one of the primary objectives of the app is to teach, so the developer who is interested in the Browser tier will want to refer to the [Samplestack Browser API Reference](https://wiki.marklogic.com/display/rootwiki/Samplestack+Browser+API+Reference).
