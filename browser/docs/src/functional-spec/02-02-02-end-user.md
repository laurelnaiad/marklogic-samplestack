### For Users

To an end-user, Samplestack is simple app.  It is developed as if for a fictional user base that roughly resembles a group that would interact on a Stack Exchange site such as Stack Overflow, and in fact the seed data used to populate the database are from Stack Overflow. Much more information is available in the [Application Narrative](https://wiki.marklogic.com/display/rootwiki/Application+Narrative+-+Stack+Overflow+data).

Wireframes have been developed to sketch the overall graphical user interface. They include User Experience (UX) specifications which outline how the interface is to derived from data and how it is to respond to user interaction.

Based on the detailed narrative and these wireframes and UX specifications, individual End-User Features have been specified.

It is these features that are considered the deliverables of the application itself. Each has a summary and a set of Scenarios which illustrate more specific requirements as to how the application and its users should be able to interact. The features are the units of testability of correctness for the application itself.

End-User Features are detailed in [section 4.2.3](#end-user-user-interface)
