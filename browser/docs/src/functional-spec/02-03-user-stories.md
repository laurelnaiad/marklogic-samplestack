## User Stories (N/A)

Because the application requirements are fictitious and were generated primarily by determine how to demonstrate key MarkLogic features, the project team decided to deprioritize user stories for the Samplestack application itself. In their stead, we are using "features" to describe interactions with the system, consistent with what is specified in the application narrative and wireframes.

The end-user features can be considered as derivatives of what would otherwise have been these user stories.
